Microracle allows users to employ the bacterial inactivation models developed in our group with their own experimental data. Alternatively, the user can simply load the available experimental data for _Escherichia coli_ and _Bacillus cereus_ and modify the model parameters to test how they affect the model output. 

Currently, the following models are available:


* Microbial nactivation by carvacrol at sub-MIC concentrations



## Authoring

Microracle has been developed by researchers of the Biosystems and Bioprocess Engineering Group (Bio2Eng) and
Recycling and Valorization of Waste Materials (REVAL) groups from the IIM-CSIC (Vigo, Spain):

* Adrián Pedreira: Web developer, experimentation and data collection.
* Míriam R. García: Development of mathematical models.  
* Nerea Martínez: Development of mathematical models. 
* Xosé A. Vázquez: Experimental design

For any question related to the mathematical models, please contact with Míriam R. García (miriamr@iim.csic.es)
Microracle is a project in early development, so you may encounter some problems on the web. To report any bug or a problem (https://github.com/apedreira/microracle), please generate a new issue in the GitHub repository or contact with Adrián Pedreira (apedreira@iim.csic.es).

> **Understanding the effect of antimicrobials on bacterial dynamics through the integration of theory and data.**

**Microracle** is an open-source web application designed to model and predict bacterial behavior under the influence of antimicrobials. It integrates experimental data with mathematical frameworks to analyze inactivation at sub-MIC levels and competitive strain dynamics.

## Access
